    "For their 2011 paper “The flavor web and food pairing principles,” four scientists analyzed 56,498 recipes downloaded from three websites—allrecipes.com, epicurious.com, and menupan.com. To support their findings, the authors published two datasets. One names the cuisine and ingredients for each recipe. The other dataset counts how often any two ingredients appear in the same recipe.\n",
